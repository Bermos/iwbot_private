# IW Bot  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Bermos/iwbot_private.svg?token=tSUhQCxKwnkynZpag6CZ&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Bermos/iwbot_private)
Discord bot for Iridium Wing.
IW is an Elite Dangerous player group that is escorting explorers through inhabited space.
I'm not expecting this bot to be useful for anyone else due to it's heavily customisation.

### SETUP

1. Install a [mysql server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) on your System
2. Setup a admin user (usually root) for that server. Don't forget his password.
3. Run the bot in the same directory as the data.json, memes.json and create_dev_db.json files
4. You get your discord token from their [dev page](https://discordapp.com/login?redirect_to=/developers/applications/me)
5. Follow the setup steps provided by the bot

Done.
