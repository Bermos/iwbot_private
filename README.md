# IW Bot  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Bermos/iwbot_private.svg?token=tSUhQCxKwnkynZpag6CZ&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Bermos/iwbot_private)
Discord bot for Iridium Wing.
IW is an Elite Dangerous player group that is escorting explorers through inhabited space.
I'm not expecting this bot to be useful for anyone else due to it's heavily customisation.

### SETUP

1. Install a mysql server on your System
2. Setup a admin user (usually root) for that server
3. Run the bot in the same directory as the data.json and create_dev_db.json files
4. Follow the setup steps provided by the bot
5. You get your discord token from: https://discordapp.com/login?redirect_to=/developers/applications/me

Done.
