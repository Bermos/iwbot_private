# IW Bot
Discord bot for Iridium Wing.
IW is an Elite Dangerous player group that is escorting explorers through inhabited space.
I'm not expecing this bot to be useful for anyone else due to it's heavely customisation.

## SETUP

1. Create a database with the .sql file "iwbot_create" for the bot.
2. Create a db-user for the bot and put that information into the "sqlinfo.json"
4. Run maven to get the .jars needed.
5. Fill in the missing information "discord.json". Token is the token your bot got from discord. idOwner your own id on discord.
6. Put both .json files in the same folder where the bot is going to run.

Done.
